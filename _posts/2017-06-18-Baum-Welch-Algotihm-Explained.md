**Baum Welch** Algorithm is used to find the unknown parameters of [Hidden Markov Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model). It uses well kown [Expectationâ€“maximization algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm) to find the maximum liklihood estimate of the parameters of a hidden markov model.<br>
While I was searching for good explaination of this concept I came acrossthis [ NPTEL's MOOC on NLP ](http://nptel.ac.in/courses/106105158/18).<br>
Here is the explaination.
